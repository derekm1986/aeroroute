I work in the aviation industry and am trying to make a program that can read flight plan routes and calculate how long they are.

As I have time I am trying to improve the program.

I am not looking for any contributors at this time.

The program does not try to understand SIDs/STARs, it only recognizes that they are next to an airport and that the string follows a specific pattern.
