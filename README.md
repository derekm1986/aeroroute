# aeroroute

I work in the aviation industry and am trying to make a program that can read flight plan routes and calculate how long they are.

I am still learning and as I have time I am trying to improve the program.

I am not looking for any contributors at this time.

The program still does not understand airways, only point-to-point routes.
